This project is a full-stack marketplace application named GrandExchange, built with React, TypeScript, Node.js and MongoDB.

The application enables users to register, explore, search, and manage items for sale, with features like categorized listings and sorting options. Users can update passwords, delete their own listings, and communicate with others via a built-in messaging system. An admin role ensures quality control by reviewing and approving listings, as well as having the authority to delete any listing. The app is fully responsive, delivering a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Instructions

You can test the application live [here](https://grandexchange.pulkki.me). Accessing admin rights in the application happens with the user in the table above.

| Username  | Password |
| - | - |
| admin  | password  |

To run the application on your local machine, start by configuring the environment variables for the backend using the code below.

```bash
# Setup ur your MongoDB URI by filling it after the equation mark
$ echo "MONGODB_URI=" > backend/.env

# Setup a secret value after the equation mark, the secret can be any string
$ echo "SECRET=" >> backend/.env
```

To run the application with Docker, execute the following commands. 

```bash
# Build the Docker image for the application
$ docker build -t grandexchange .

# Run the Docker container in detached mode, mapped to port 3000
$Â docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 grandexchange
```

Once the Docker container is running, you can access the application locally at port `3000`.

Alternatively, you can run the [front-](/frontend) and [backend](/backend) separately by following the instructions in their directories.

### Categories

Categories has to be added in to the MongoDB database manually for now. Categories have only one field, `name`.

### Admin

To access admin rights with your user account, you need to grant the admin role manually in your MongoDB database. After creating a user, update the user document directly in the database by adding `admin: true`. 

Listings waiting for approval now show up in the 'My Account' -page.
