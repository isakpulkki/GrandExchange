# Frontend

The frontend is built with React.js and TypeScript for the GrandExchange application.

### Usage
```bash
# Install the necessary dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the server in developement mode
$ npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, the frontend should be up and accessible in your browser.
