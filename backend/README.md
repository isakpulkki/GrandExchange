# Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB as the database for the GrandExchange application. Before running, make sure you have generated a `.env` -file, instructions given in the [README.md](/README.md). 

### Usage
```bash
# Install the necessary dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the server in developement mode
$ npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, you can access the API locally at port `3000`.
